<h1>Chapter Six</h1>

Two days later, much to Olivia’s dismay, her father invited the Whitlock family to stay at the palace for a while. Her and Prince Emerson both knew that this day would come, but it didn’t mean that they wanted it to happen, but they knew that it’s for the better of both kingdoms that this marriage happens. <br><br>

The royal family is currently standing on the steps to the palace, awaiting the arrival of the other royal family. <br><br>

Not a minute later, four horses drawing a carriage pull up to the gates of the palace. The servants let the carriage in, and the royal family emerges from it, holding their heads high. The Ambrose family bows and curtsies to the Whitlock family in greeting.<br><br>

“Your majesties, it’s a pleasure that you were able to stay with us for a while.” King Darius addresses.<br><br> 

“Thank you for having us, your highness. I do hope that this marriage works out. Don’t want another war to happen, do we?” the other king chuckles.<br><br>

“No we don’t, King Felix. No we don’t. Please, come in.”<br><br>
      
The Ambrose family escorts the Whitlock family into the palace, catching up with each other. Little did Miles, Olivia and Jake know, but the kings actually were friends. The only reason the war ended was because the king before King Felix died because of old age, and since the two kings were friends, they ended the war in order to preserve their friendship. In order to not seem weak, King Felix let King Darius defeat him in the duel to end the war. But in the end, the two kings were still able to keep their friendship alive, and end the war. Sure,the kingdom of Ilratheino now thinks that their new king is weak, but they decide to believe the only reason he lost was because he’s a new king and since Kind Darius has been in power longer, so he’s had more training.<br><br> 

“Olivia dear, would you please escort Prince Emerson to his room please?” Queen Fiona asked.<br><br>

“Of course.” <br><br>

Olivia leads Prince Emerson down the many corridors of the palace. She stops on the fifth floor of the palace in front of two very royal looking doors. Coincidentally, his room is right beside Olivia’s. Actually, the entire Whitlock family’s rooms are on this floor. <br><br>

“Thank you, <em>Princess Olivia</em>.” he says, giving Olivia a mock bow. <br><br>

Olivia rolls her eyes at him and gives him a playful shove to his shoulder. <br><br>

“Careful now. Don’t want any roughhousing in the palace, do we?” Emerson asks, earning another eye roll from Olivia. <br><br>

“I’ll see you at dinner, <em>Prince Emerson</em>.” Olivia taunts, then heads into her room. <br>

<p>Olivia changed into a lavender gown with silver accents, a pair of silver heels redid her make-up, lightly curled her hair, picked up her favourite book and headed towards the palace gardens. She always found comfort in the peace and quiet that came with the gardens. She sat on one of the benches and opened her book.<br><br> 

A few minutes later, she hears someone approaching, but ignores it, figuring that it’s just someone who was exploring.<br><br> 

“Can I join you?” Olivia hears a familiar voice ask. <br><br>

She looks up from her book to see Prince Emerson standing in front of her with a smile on his face. <br><br>

“Sure.” she says, returning to her book.<br><br>

“What are you reading?”<br><br>

“Just some book my father gave me when I was ten.” Olivia answers, wondering why he wanted to join her. <br><br>

“How badly do you want this marriage to happen?” <br><br>

“What?” she asks, closing her book, confused on why he asked her that.<br><br>

“How badly do you want this marriage to happen?” he repeats. <br><br>

    <em>So that’s why he’s here.</em><br><br>

“If I’m being honest, I don’t know. Like, I knew that this day would come, but it’s not my preferred way of getting married. But I know that it’s for the better of both kingdoms. Why?”<br><br>

“Just curious. You do know that we have to get to know each other better for this marriage to work, right?” Emerson points out. <br><br>

“Yeah, I know.”<br><br>

“So, let’s get to know each other better.”<br><br>

Olivia simply rolls her eyes at him.<br><br>

“You know, if you keep doing that, your eyes are going to get stuck up there.” <br><br>

“Come on, Mr. Whitlock. Let’s get to know each other better.”<br>

</p>

<p>The two of them walked around the gardens for a while, talking about their pasts, what they like, and stuff like that. <br><br>

“I’m sorry about your brother. I know that he meant a lot to you.” Emerson says. <br><br>

“Thanks. That means a lot. Now, I’m pretty sure that it’s dinner now. You don’t want our parents to freak out about if we’re missing or not, do you?”<br><br>

“Meh. They’ll just think that we’re together somewhere in the palace.” he shrugs. <br><br>

“That sounds wrong, Emerson. Now, come on. Let’s go.”<br><br>

The two of them head to the dinning hall and take their seats. Like usual, Olivia sits beside Queen Fiona, but instead of Donovan sitting on her left, Emerson is, and his family sitting to his left.<em> Man, they’re really trying to get Emerson and I together</em>. Olivia thought.<br>
