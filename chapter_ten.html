<h1>Chapter Ten</h1>

<p>Olivia returned to her investigation duties the next day, and Miles returned to training the guards. <br><br>

Olivia wore her usual black outfit and met up with the scholars.<br><br>

"Did you guys find anything?" she asks them.<br><br>

"Yes. After investigation, we discovered that the knife that killed your brother was from the kitchen. We studied the knife and discovered it was coated in Moonshadow poison. After carefully inspecting the blood sample from General Carlos, General Adrien, and the knife, we discovered the same batch of poison in each person. That means this person has a giant tub of this poison lying around and is storing it in the palace. I would like you to ask your father if we can have a full inspection of the kitchens and interrogate every staff member in the kitchens. We need to get to this before anyone else gets hurt." Mia explains.<br><br>

"Of course. I will tell my father the second after we finish today. Is there anything else I need to know, or can we look around the kitchen before we get experts?"<br><br>

"Let's head inside."<br><br>

The six scholars and Olivia headed to the kitchens to see what they could find. Sadly, they could only find something violating the rules her father put in place. The only way that they could find out more was if he let them. Olivia was planning to talk to him about it as soon as possible. <br><br>

After they were done for the day, Olivia immediately headed for her father's study. She knocked on the door and waited until her father let her in.<br><br>

"What can I help you with?" he asks her.<br><br>

"I wish to ask you for permission to investigate the kitchens and properly interrogate the kitchen staff thoroughly. The scholars discovered that the knife that killed Donovan came from the kitchens. When General Carlos was killed, they also found a bottle of Moonshadow poison. I also wish to look through the poison records, see what was done with it in the last three months, and see who would have it in our kingdom."<br><br>

"Very well. I'll tell the search team to investigate the kitchen staff's kitchens and houses. You may interrogate them at 3:00 pm tomorrow. I will make sure that they are all there."<br><br>

"Thank you, father," she says, exiting the room. <br><br>

Letting her team rest for the day, Olivia searches for Scarlet, knowing she wouldn't hang out with Miles since he's training all day.<br><br>

"Hey, Scarlet."<br><br>

"Oh, hey, Olivia. By the way, there's no reason for you always to call me Scarlet. Call me Scar if you want."<br><br>

"Very well, Scar. You can call me Liv as well if you want."<br><br>

"Sure thing"<br><br>

"Want to hang out?"<br><br>

"Sure. What do you have in mind?"<br><br>

"I don't know. All I know is I must get away from boys for a little while."<br><br>

"Me too." Scarlet chuckles.<br><br> 

They go to Olivia's salon, doing each other's make-up and nails. <br><br>

"You know, I've never had anyone to do this with. Usually, my maids do this, and that isn't much fun." Olivia says.<br><br>

"Same here. Not the whole maid thing, but doing this by yourself is boring. I'm glad that you're doing this with me. And it's good to get away from the boys for a while." Scarlet responds. <br><br>

"True."<br><br>

"So, I have to ask. You and Emerson are engaged, but Miles told me it was an arranged marriage. Do you love him?"<br><br>

"Honestly, I'm not sure. Our fathers have been friends for a long time, even during the war. He was my first friend, mainly because our fathers always made us hang out together. We both knew since we were fifteen that we would have to marry each other someday, but at the time, we didn't want that. I wanted to find love, and Emerson was always tired of being controlled by his parents, and the news didn't help with that. After a little while, I feel like he eventually got used to the fact that we would have to marry each other but didn't realize it would be so soon. Thank my brother Jake for making that happen. I could get to love him through marriage, sure, but it's only been two days since we got engaged. Before that, we were simply friends. It's not like things are going to stay mostly the same days. But who knows, right?"<br><br>

"I guess."<br><br>

"Why do you ask?"<br><br>

"I just figured since you were so close, you felt something towards him, at least."<br><br>

"Can we talk about something else?"<br><br>

"Like what?"<br><br>

"I don't know. How about when I saw you kissing my brother the day of the ball."<br><br>

"Y-you saw that?" she stammers, blushing.<br><br>

"Yup."<br>

 <p align= "center"> <img src= "pixil-frame-0 (1).png"> </p>

The rest of the day was the two of them talking and enjoying each other's company. <br><br>

Once Scarlet left, Olivia pondered about what Scarlet had told her. <br><br>

Did she feel something more toward Emerson? She shook her head. No, no. I can't. He's my best friend. That would be weird. Then again, they were engaged, so how much more bizarre can things get?<br><br>

The entire night she thought about that one question. Did she feel anything more towards Emerson other than being friends? At some point during the night, she realized that she did. She always knew she felt something more towards him, but she thought it was because he was her best friend. Now, there was no way that she could deny it. She'd inadvertently fallen for her best friend. She mentally cursed herself for that but realized that he could feel the same. Then her mind started spinning about whether he thought the same or not. She eventually realized that it was a lost cause to try to figure it out at 2 a.m. and just decided to get some sleep.<br><br>
