<p>Two years later, everything is still peaceful.
<br><br>
King Darius granted Ilratheino freedom, keeping the friendship between the two kings alive. 
<br><br>
Miles and Scarlet had gotten married a few months after peace was restored, like Jake had predicted. Miles’s family was ecstatic about the wedding, planning every single detail like they would die if they messed up. The wedding was definitely grand, but not as grand as the king and queen would’ve liked, due to Miles and Scarlet requesting that it not be like normal royal weddings.
<br><br>
For Olivia on the other hand, her wedding with Emerson was exactly like normal royal weddings. Their parents made sure that this wouldn’t be a wedding to forget, celebrating the peace that will forever remain between the two kingdoms.
<br><br>
With peace between the Kingdom of Eslarthia and the Kingdom of Ilratheino, the two kingdoms can relax, not having to fear being attacked by each other. 
<br><br>
When Miles turns 25, King Darius will relinquish his crown, and give it to Miles, letting him rule the Kingdom. With this coming up, the press have been bombarding Scarlet with a multitude of questions every time she would exit the palace to visit her father, but she’s been taking it surprisingly well. She would simply ignore them and keep going on their way. She really was meant to be a queen.
<br><br>
For Olivia and Emerson on the other hand, since Emerson will become King in a few months, since he’s already 25, there was even more pressure on the two of them. The press would bombard the two of them every time they would walk out of the palace, and they would always have to either have escorts to their carriages, or just not go out because that’s all that would happen. 
<br><br>
Besides always being the public eye for every little move, the two couples were happy, and the two kingdoms were at peace. 
<br><br>
They had no reason to start another fight, given the fact that the current kings are friends, Olivia is wed with the Crowned Prince of Ilratheino, and when Emerson and Miles become the kings of the kingdoms, they will keep the peace for they are good friends. 
<br><br>
The two kingdoms will have peace for a long time, until something terrible happens. 
<br><br>
Something that shouldn’t happen for a very long time.
<br><br>
They hope.
