<h1>Chapter Four</h1>

    <p>The following day, everyone was tired, sad, and on edge. Every little thing ticked them off. For the king, if a servant had accidentally been late in getting him a drink, he snapped at them instead of ignoring it like usual, sending the servant running away to fetch another one. For Olivia, if a maid had pulled on her hair too tight, she would snap at them and send all of the maids out of her room and tell them that she could do it herself. Miles was training until he would drop in the barracks, needing to take his anger out on something. And Jake was constantly running through the events of the kingdom, trying to preoccupy himself with anything that could take his mind off of Donovan.<br><br> 
        
Olivia wasn't in the mood to investigate the case today. She left the investigating to the scholars, trusting them not to screw things up. She told them to find out as much about Donovan's death as possible and to figure out who the fingerprint on the knife belonged to. <br><br>

After breakfast, she changed into her training outfit, and joined Miles in the barracks. <br><br>

“So, why is my little sister training today? Why aren’t you investigating right now?” Miles asked her, playfully shoving her shoulder. <br><br>

“I’m younger than you by two minutes.” she retorts, rolling her eyes at him.<br><br>

“Still older though. Now seriously, answer the question.”<br><br>

"I don't feel like it. Not after you know. Why do you ask? Do you not want me to join you?"<br><br>

"Of course not! You're always welcome to train with me. I only asked because it's not like you. And I get it. I know how much he meant to you. He meant a lot to me too. I know it's way too early to say this to you, but you can't grieve about him forever. The kingdom needs you now more than ever to figure out who is behind this case. And besides, he wouldn't want you to either. He would want you to celebrate life with everything you have. Don't be stuck in the past; think about what you could do differently." Miles says.<br><br>

"Thanks, Miles. Now, come on. I'll race you there!" Olivia shouts, bolting towards the barracks. <br><br>

Miles rolls his eyes and chases after her. <br><br>

They make it to the barracks, doubled over, trying to catch their breath. <br><br>

“How are you so fast?” Miles asks her, gasping for air.<br><br>

“Training. Now, come on. We’re here, aren’t we? Let’s get started.”<br>

    </p>
    
    <p>Jake is doing everything he can in the palace to get his mind off, Donovan.<br><br>

Currently, he's in a meeting with his father and the generals of the kingdom, trying to figure out how to tell the public. All they know right now about all of this is that the prince is dead. They don't know how he died or about General Carlos's murder, either.<br><br>

"We can't just tell them the truth! There will be protests, and we don't need that right now." one of the king's generals exclaims.<br><br>

"Enough!" the king shouts, fed up with everyone calling ideas, arguments, remarks, all of it. "The public deserves to know what's going on. I've always prided myself that the royal family has been open to the public about what's happening in the palace. I'm not losing that now. I know it's hazardous to tell them, for it could make the murderer more desperate, but we need to. I owe it to this kingdom to do at least that. We need to devise a plan that lets the public know what's going on without freaking them out. They need to know that this situation is under control and that nothing like this will happen again."<br><br>

The council shuts up at the king’s message. <br><br>

“Jake, son? Do you have any suggestions on how to handle this?” the king asks him.<br><br>

"What! You're asking a sixteen-year-old child how to handle this instead of one of us! He has barely any experience in this stuff. The rest of us have been doing this for over half our lives! How can you trust his judgement more than one of us!" General Morgan protests, making the king angry.<br><br>

"How dare you talk to my son like that. And to answer your question, I trust my son's judgement better than yours because my son knows when not to state his opinion out of turn. He also doesn't go around shouting about how inexperienced everyone is. I could list a hundred things about you that I don't like, about how inexperienced and immature you are, but you don't see me doing that. Now, I suggest you keep quiet for the rest of this meeting. If not, you will be sent to the dungeons, and we will figure out your punishment from there." the king scolds. Nobody challenges the king. Especially when he's threatening your life, thankfully, he shut up.<br><br> 
Thankfully, he shut up. Nobody challenges the king. Especially when he’s threatening your life. <br><br>

Jake thought over all of the palace's options in telling the kingdom about what happened and figured out the best possible option. He explains this to the council, and they all nod in agreement, surprised that a sixteen-year-old knows so much about politics.<br><br> 

After some more discussion, the meeting adjourned.<br><br>

Jake exited the council room and went in search of Olivia. Thankfully, he didn't have to look too hard, for he saw her rounding the corner, laughing at something Miles said.<br><br> 

"Well, if it isn't the twins. Tell me, what mischief did you two get into today?" Jake asked them, smirking.<br><br>

"We weren't up to anything! I swear!" Olivia shouted, throwing her hands up in defence.<br><br>

"Sure….. Hey, Olivia, can I talk to you for a moment?" <br><br>

She nodded, bids Miles farewell, then followed Jake down the corridor. <br><br>

“What’s up?” <br><br>

“I think you should check his room.” Jake suggests.<br><br>

“Why?”<br><br>

“Did something happen before he……. You know…….?”<br><br>

“I just gave him some samples I needed to examine.” Olivia responded. <br><br>

"That's it. The reason Donovan was, you know, was because he found something. You should check his room to see if he discovered anything before, you know….." <br><br>

“I’ll try.”<br><br>

And with that, she strolled down the corridor, walking towards her quarters. <br>
        <p align= "center"> <img src= "pixil-frame-0 (1).png"> </p>
</p>
    
    <p>Jake's suggestion kept nagging at her mind. She kept thinking about whether to check out his room but could never bring herself to do it. There were too many memories there. Since their rooms were beside each other, whenever she heard him cry when he was little, she would always come in to comfort him. It was hard to believe someone thought they should murder a fifteen-year-old boy. Ultimately, she shoved her feelings aside and approached Donovan's door. She stood in front of the door, hesitating. With shaky hands, she slowly turns the knob, stepping into the room. The maids did an excellent job because it looked like nothing had happened.<br><br> 

If she closed her eyes, she could imagine everything was like three years ago. Those were probably the best years of her life. She and Miles were seventeen, Jake was thirteen, and Donovan was eleven. Back then, she didn't have a care in the world. She and her siblings get along so well that you would think it's a miracle that they got along so well, but then again, they're twins. They have some telepathic thing that lets them understand one another better. Back then, she didn't have to worry about a murderer lurking in the palace. She didn't have to worry about her brother training him and the guard until they dropped to protect the castle. She didn't have to think that her other brother would be murdered a few minutes after seeing him.<br><br> 

The problem was that she always knew what her life would be like. When she and her brother turned 21, her brother would have to be married to some girl from the kingdom so that the Ambrose line could continue. On the other hand, Olivia was to marry the prince of Ilratheino. Her father told her when she was fifteen that she would have to marry him so that peace would remain when one kingdom eventually won the war. Or if the war were still going on, their marriage would end it. She's had the pleasure of meeting him once before, and he didn't seem too bad, but she still didn't want to marry him. She would prefer to marry someone she truly cares about, not some entitled prince who thinks he owns the world. Sadly for her, her birthday is two weeks, meaning she will have to marry the prince a few months later.<br><br> 

She missed her life when she was young. And now, nothing will ever be the same. <br><br>

Olivia flicks on the lights to Donovan's study, heart aching. She walks over to the station where she knows Donovan used to experiment and looks around. Olivia's looking through stacks of paper, in drawers, in anything that could give her some information about the phials she gave him. Olivia's rummaging through drawers when she comes across one drawer that is locked. She looks for the key, but it's nowhere to be seen. Knowing Donovan, he probably had the key after closing the drawer. With this information, she knew she would have to lock-pick the drawer. Thankfully for her, being an expert in investigation, she was taught how to lock pick anything. She pulls out the silver lock-picking set her father gave her for her birthday a few years ago and unlocked the drawer. She pulls the drawer open with a lot of effort and pulls it open.<br><br> 

Inside the drawer is a giant stack of papers, some of which are copies of information the palace got Donovan to study. But resting on the top of the pile was precisely what she was looking for. One double-sided sheet of paper gives Olivia all the information she needs to continue her investigation. Olivia folds the paper and shoves it into the pocket of the training jumper she's still wearing.<br><br>
</p>
    
    <p>She exited Donovan's study and headed to her own. She changed into black leggings, a purple t-shirt, combat boots, and a navy blue hoodie. She transferred the paper into the pocket of her hoodie and headed straight to her father.<br><br> 

She knocked on the doors to her father's study and waited. One of her father's servants opened the doors, and she walked in.<br><br> 

“How may I help you?” her father asked.<br><br>

“I was looking through Donovan’s study, and found some important information..”<br><br>

"Thank you, Olivia. That is much appreciated. I know how hard it must have been to go there. Why don't you tell me and the generals this at our next council meeting? It will be tomorrow at noon."<br>
