<h1>Chapter Five</h1>

    <p>The next day, Olivia was sitting beside her mother around the large table that the council was gathered around. <br><br>

“Your majesty, not to be rude at all, but may I ask why your children are going to us today?” one of the generals asked the king, motioning towards Olivia and her brother, them already being used to Jake being there.<br><br> 

“Excellent question, General Morgan. Though I find you questioning my childrens’ presence at this council annoying. I know you think that since they are so young, they can’t do everything that must happen, but I assure you they can. Olivia is the best investigator in the entire continent. Even Ilratheino said so, and they hate our guts. Miles is the best fighter that this world has ever seen. And Jake is more capable of military and political strategies than most of you here. If you’re done interrupting me, I would like to continue.” King Darius scolds.<br><br> 

“Of course, your majesty.” he nods, falling further into his seat. <br><br>

“Now, if any of you don’t have anything to add, Olivia, would you please tell us the information you have collected?” the king asked her. <br><br>

“Excellent question, General Morgan. Though I find you questioning my childrens’ presence at this council annoying. I know you think that since they are so young, they can’t do everything that must happen, but I assure you they can. Olivia is the best investigator in the entire continent. Even Ilratheino said so, and they hate our guts. Miles is the best fighter that this world has ever seen. And Jake is more capable of military and political strategies than most of you here. If you’re done interrupting me, I would like to continue.” King Darius scolds.<br><br>

    <p>“After my brother’s death, I got the scholars to run some tests on the knife that killed him. When I get the results back, I can see if the fingerprints are the same on the phial as on the knife. Until further notice, I have no other information about the investigation about the murderer.”<br><br>

“Thank you, Olivia. General Adrien, Miles, status on the guard?” <br><br>

“The guard is ready for the first sign of the enemy.” General Adrien answers. <br><br>

“Very good. Jake, any ideas for progress on the issue at hand?” <br><br>

“I have processed every possible way of telling the public and the outcome that each way would have, and I have figured out the best way forward. I suggest that first, we make sure that the public knows the true reason as to why Donovan was killed. If not, they will get suspicious, and we don’t need them to start getting the wrong ideas. After that, we will tell them that General Carlos is dead. We can tell them he was poisoned, but not the type of poison used. If we do, chaos and mayhem will ensue. We will then post the guard on the outskirts of the kingdom, preventing the murderer from escaping, and to assure the public that they are safe within the kingdom, and that we won’t let the murderer get away unharmed. And Miles, Olivia, I’m sorry about this, but you two must be engaged as soon as possible. Miles, we would have to throw a ball to find you a suitable match, and Olivia, we would need you to be engaged to Prince Emerson. We need our kingdom to think that we are strong.” Jake explains.<br><br>

At the mention of having to be engaged soon, Olivia was angry. She always knew this day would come, but she hoped she’d at least have a week or two to get it together, not a few days.<br><br>

Miles hated the idea of being engaged to a complete stranger. Sure that it’s for the better of the kingdom, but he still hated the idea. Miles at least wanted to know the person before he had to marry them. Miles had one girl in mind that he wanted to marry, but he knew it was unlikely that his parents would allow that. Then again, even though it’s protocol to throw a huge gala and the prince chooses one girl from the gala to marry, his father never did that. He married his mother because he truly loved her. Maybe his father would allow him to do the same.<br><br> 

He met this girl when he was sixteen because of one of the feasts that his father threw. She was only a few months younger than him and helped her father at work. He wanted to convince her father to sell him something, and invited his family to join them for dinner. His father periodically asked her family to join them for dinner, and hoped that their children would have a connection.<br><br>
    </p>
    
    <p>After a few dinners together, Miles learned her name was Scarlet Cyprus. If he was being honest, she was gorgeous. She had long, silky, honey blonde hair, ocean blue eyes and a smile that could light up the room. Her and her father ran the best blacksmith shop in the entire kingdom. Every time that his father said that her father would be joining them for dinner, he would always hope that Scarlet would be coming as well. At this point, it was clear that he liked her, but he was sure she would never want him back.<br><br> 

He was never the child with the looks. Olivia has long, silky, dark brown hair, almond eyes, and curves that compliment her features. Jake has messy dirty blond hair, but not so chaotic that he looks like he just woke up. Jake has soft green eyes and a kind smile. Miles on the other hand has messy dark brown hair that is always a hassle to contain, his brown eyes are the same as his father’s, no matter what his mood, his eyes always look like he’s angry. Sure, he’s built strong, but it’s hard to see under the suit his father always makes him wear.<br><br>

Miles realized that he was zoning out in the thought of the ball that he wasn’t paying any attention to what his father was saying. <br>

“-And if any of you don’t have anything else to add, this meeting is adjourned.” King Darius announces, standing up and signaling for his family to join him. <br><br>
