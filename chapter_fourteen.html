<h1>Chapter Fourteen</h1>

<p>The next morning, Olivia was still in the hospital, not being permitted to leave, to give her injuries a bit more time to heal. <br><br>

She turned her head to see Emerson sitting on a plush couch beside the hospital bed. <br><br>

“How long have you been there?” she asked him groggily. <br><br>

“The whole night,” he answered calmly.<br><br>

“You didn’t have to do that.” <br><br>

“I know, but I wanted to. I needed to make sure you were alright. You practically collapsed in my arms when we left the meeting with your parents. Needed to make sure that you weren’t going to die on me.” he told her.<br><br>

“You know that I wouldn’t do that to you. You can’t get rid of me that easily.” Olivia jokes, earning an eye roll from Emerson.<br><br>

“How are you doing with the injuries?”<br><br>

She slowly sits up, wincing at all of the stitches that the doctors gave her.<br><br>

“As good as anyone with this many injuries. How’s Miles and Scarlet doing?”<br><br>

“They’re okay. They came in a few times to check on you. Your parents came in a couple times as well.” Emerson states.<br><br>

“Has the doctor permitted me to leave yet?”<br><br>

“Yeah, just take it easy, okay? She gave me a bunch of painkillers if you need them as well.”<br><br>

“Thanks, Em. Now can you help me up, please?” <br><br>

Emerson helps Olivia get out of the hospital bed, letting her place her weight on him as they walk out of the hospital wing.<br><br>

Olivia ducked into her room quickly to change out of the dirty clothes that she wore the other day into something more princess-like. It was nothing like the usual gowns that she wore, due to her injuries, but she still looked royal nonetheless. She changed into a white sundress with gold accents on the dress. She slipped on some pastel coloured wedges, saving her feet from walking in heels for the day. <br><br>

Emerson helped her walk down to the same room that they were in the day before, the rest already being there.<br><br>

“Olivia, Emerson, I’m glad that you could finally make it. How are you doing, Olivia? I heard that you had sustained many injuries during your battle.” Queen Fiona says.<br><br>

“I’m okay, thank you for asking.”<br><br>

The two of them sit on the same couch as before, waiting for the meeting to commence.<br><br>

“Now that everyone is here, we need to talk about what to do with the prisoner.” King Darius states. “King Felix, Queen Fiona, since he’s from your kingdom, we give you a choice on what we do with him. Either we execute him in front of the entire kingdom, or you can take him back to Ilratheino and serve his punishment there.”<br><br>

“That is very kind of you, King Darius, but we feel like, since he did so much damage to your family and your kingdom, you have the right to do whatever you want with him.”<br><br>

“Thank you, your majesties. Now, we should probably inform the council about our decision.”<br><br>

And so, both royal families exited the lounge, and entered the council chambers. <br><br>

“Your highness, not to be rude or anything, but why is the Whitlock family joining us this morning?” one of the generals asks the king.<br><br>

“Because they are our honoured guests, and you will treat them with respect.” King Darius scolds, taking his place at the head of the table.<br><br>

“Now, the Whitlock family and mine have come to a conclusion about what will happen to the prisoner, but first, Miles, Olivia, Scarlet, Emerson, would you be willing to tell the council what happened while you were gone, please?” the king asks. <br><br>

The four of them share a glance, and they all signal for Olivia to recall everything that conspired that day. <br><br>

Olivia took a deep breath, and before she got to speak, the same person that asked why the Whitlock family was joining them, interrupted her.<br><br>

“What? No big, fancy gown this time?” he snickered. <br><br>

“Get out!” the king shouts, but the general stays put.<br><br>

“Guards!”<br><br>

And so, three guards carried the general out of the chamber, kicking and screaming. <br><br>

“I’m sorry about that, Olivia. Please continue.” the king tells her.<br><br>

“Well, the four of us, some scholars and a dozen guardsmen rode out of the palace yesterday morning. The scholars and I were able to find the prisoner’s trail pretty quickly and followed it to a village a few kilometres away from the palace. When we got there, the prisoner and a group of about two dozen men were waiting for us in a large park in the centre of the village. For no apparent reason, the prisoner told us the reason why he killed all of the people in the palace. He told us that the reason he did it was because the late king, Gabriel Whitlock sent him to the palace to take us down when Ilratheino fell. He told him to kill as many people as possible, killing the royal family last. Then, we went into battle. We killed the majority of the army that he’d rallied, and the rest are currently being detained in the dungeons at the moment. All that awaits now is what we do with the prisoner.”<br><br>

“Thank you, Olivia. As I said as I walked in, the Whitlock family and mine have decided what we are going to do with the prisoner. He will be executed, and we will broadcast it to the entire kingdom. Let them know that the danger is gone and everything can go back to normal.”<br>

The next day, the royal family was trying to figure out how exactly they’re going to tell the public about the execution. <br><br>

They had the servants clean up the arena for this, since the Kingdom of Eslarthia had a very strange way of doing executions. They would throw the person into the arena, and around three to five people from the kingdom would enter as well, and they would kill him right then and there. Like I said, strange. <br><br>

The royal family still needed to figure out who would be the executioners. They’d agreed that one of them would be Miles, but the other four are currently undecided.<br><br>

“Can I do it?” Olivia asks.<br><br>

“Liv, there’s no way that I’m letting you in there. You’re still healing from your last battle.” Emerson tells her.<br><br>

“Em, I’m fine and you know that. I’ve been training, and my leg and hip feel fine. Also, I want to avenge my brother. I was in the same room as him when the murderer was in there and I just left him there. Left him alone to fend for himself when he didn’t even know that the danger was there. Please, let me do this.” she begged.<br><br>

The king and queen shared a glance, then the king sighed. <br><br>

“Fine, you can fight. Actually, why don’t you, Miles, Emerson, Scarlet, and Jake be the executioners?” the king asks her.<br><br>

“Sure.”<br><br>
