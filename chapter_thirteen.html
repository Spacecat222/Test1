<h1>Chapter Thirteen</h1>

<p>The next four hours were the four of them getting everything they needed to head out the next day. Scarlet's father had provided her and Emerson with all the gear that they would need. Miles had gathered a group of twelve men, deeming that they were the best men in the kingdom. Olivia had also collected a couple of scholars to help the group track down the missing prisoner. <br><br>

 <p align= "center"> <img src= "pixil-frame-0 (1).png"> </p>

The next day, the four met at the gates at the first rays of sunlight. The scholars and the guardsmen are waiting for them just on the other side of the gates. Miles left his top general in charge and sent orders for the guard to surround the kingdom, not letting anyone in or out. <br><br>

"You guys ready to go?" Miles asks them.<br><br>

"Absolutely."<br><br>

They meet up with the others, and they head out. The guardsmen pull a large wagon filled with armour and weapons with horses. Miles, Olivia, Scarlet, and Emerson ride horseback in front of the wagon. Olivia is riding a midnight black horse with green eyes, and Miles is riding a dark grey horse with stormy grey eyes, both horses given to the twins by their parents on their eighteenth birthday. Emerson rides a pearl white horse with jet black prominent and sky blue eyes. And Scarlet is riding a caramel brown horse with dark brown prominent and charcoal black eyes given to her by her father. <br><br>

The scholars are riding in the front, looking to see if they can pick up the prisoner's trail. <br><br>

After a few minutes of riding, the scholars can finally pick up the prisoner's trail. The group rides as fast as they can toward the path. They rode for many hours, only stopping for food and water. The course abruptly ended in the centre of a village far from Scarlet's home village. <br><br>

Everyone gets off their horses and spreads out to try and recover their trail. After about half an hour with little to no avail, the team regrouped in the centre of the village, at the crossroad between a park, a school, a church, and a row of houses. <br><br>

"How can this happen?" Emerson asks. "People can't just disappear, can they?"<br><br>

"Not that I know of. Then again, strange things have happened since the war ended, so I wouldn't be surprised if there was such a thing as magic now." Olivia commented. <br><br>

"We have to keep going. We need to find that prisoner before he hurts anyone else." Miles tells us.<br><br>

"You mean me?" A deep voice calls, standing in the middle of the park. Behind him are about two dozen people, all with weapons in hand.<br><br>

The group reacting as quickly as possible grabs their weapons and hastily throws on their armour. Miles, Olivia, Emerson, and Scarlet are the only people not bothering to put some on. All they grab is their weapon of choice. For Miles, it is a hand-and-a-half sword fixed with obsidian and gold accents on the hilt. For Olivia, it is a two-handed sword with sapphires and silver accents on the grip. The twins' blades match their house colours. Emerson carries a pistol in a pouch on his belt, and a long sword with pearls and emeralds on the hilt falls over his left hip. Scarlet pulled out a long one-handed sword with garnets and rubies on the handle. Pretty much everyone in the group fought with swords except for the scholars. They backed into the streets, not wanting to get in the way since they had little to no fighting experience. <br><br>

The one disadvantage that the group has over the prisoner, other than numbers, is that the prisoner's group has a variety of weapons ranging from maces to spiked balls on chains. <br><br>

The guardsmen tossed everyone a shield, which they all easily caught, and they walked up to the other group. <br><br>

"Who are you?" Miles demanded in a voice that fits the crowned prince nicely.<br><br>

"My name is Demetri Valdarus, and I am here for revenge. You killed my entire family during the war. My parents, my wife, and even my children were murdered at the hands of you and your father. Before King Gabriel Whitlock died, he sent me on a mission. He knew that he was leaving this world soon, and since the king knew that his son would side with your kingdom because your king was his best friend, the king knew that he needed me to infiltrate your palace. He told me that once Ilratheino fell into your hands, that's when I should start. Honestly, it was easier than I thought it would be. Your king is a little too soft-hearted, I'll say. He let me in, and it was easy to plot my revenge. I'd start with your father's right-hand man, then carry on further up the ranks until I got to you and your father. I planned on killing the other brother, but he was always with someone. Thankfully I managed to kill the other one, though. That girl over there," He gestured to Olivia. "Almost screwed up my plans, though. I'd been hiding in his room for the past hour when he was researching, and I was about to attack when she decided to walk in. Thankfully she left, and I could continue. I have to admit, it was easier to kill him than I thought it would. Didn't even put up a fight."<br><br>

With those words, Miles and Olivia had it. It was painful enough to hear that this man wanted everyone in their family dead, but to explain exactly how he had managed to kill their brother struck their last nerve. The two of them attacked simultaneously, slashing at the man's throat. He had barely managed to dodge the blow, stumbling back into the group he'd gathered. <br><br>

With the twins striking first, the battle commenced. <br><br>

The two groups charged at each other, battle cries ringing throughout the village. The guardsmen had the advantage of skill in this one, being trained 24/7 by Miles. The scholars were still watching from the sidelines, knowing they would be useless in this situation. The twins were caught in the middle of about half a dozen people attacking them, one of them being the escaped prisoner. Scarlet was doing well because of being the daughter of a blacksmith, and Emerson was holding his own against a group of attackers. Olivia had many minor cuts along her legs and arms, and Miles had a slice at his ribs, both due to them not wearing armour, but they didn't care. All that mattered was ending this battle, killing the prisoner or capturing him and bringing him back to the palace.<br><br>

Olivia is fighting three people at a time, not knowing how she's still alive. The three attackers aren't using swords, unfortunately. One is swinging a spiked ball on a large wooden stick, another is using an axe, and the other is using a spear. She swept the legs of the person with the axe and dealt a deadly blow to his throat. She blocked a jab at her chest from the spear with her shield, then decapitated the person. And finally, she managed to somehow kick the spiked ball out of the last person's hand and stabbed him through his heart. <br><br>

Unfortunately, while pulling her sword out of the man's chest, one of the attackers that had slipped by her brother landed a deep wound to her right hip. The man went in for another blow, but he dodged the blow and impaled his heart. Olivia cried out in pain but made sure that no tears followed it. Despite being unable to press weight on her right leg, she managed to kill a couple more enemies. Sadly, in the process, because of her injury, she managed to get a deep gash extending from her left shoulder blade to her wrist, and another from the middle of her left thigh, trailing down her leg to the bottom of her ankle. <br><br>

Olivia could ignore her injuries because the adrenaline flowed through her, and she lunged at the escaped prisoner. Miles helped her, the two attacking as ideally in sync as before. They pinned him to the ground, and Miles tied ropes around his wrists and ankles, preventing him from escaping again. <br><br>

Olivia was once again swept into battle, the attackers fighting even harder because their leader was defeated. <br><br>

Thankfully for her, the battle ended shortly after. Most enemies were slain on the grass or surrendered, and the guards tied them up with ropes in the wagon. <br><br>

"Oh my god! Olivia! Are you okay!" Emerson panics, taking in her blended appearance. <br><br>

Olivia sits on the grass, leaning against one of the trees bordering the park. She's bleeding from her arm, leg, hip, and every single cut. Emerson rushed over to her, fingers death gripping a roll of bandages. He kneels beside her, instantly starting to bandage her up. She winces at the pain when he tightens the application around her hip.<br><br>

"Are you okay? It looks like you lost a lot of blood." Emerson asks her.<br><br>

"Emerson, I got stabbed through the hip, slashed on my arm and leg and lost about five litres of blood, and you're asking me if I'm okay? I feel like I'm about to pass out right now. Can we finish rounding up the attackers and return to the palace, please?" Olivia pleads, shakily getting to her feet. She tries to take a few steps forward but collapses, unable to put weight on either of her legs. Emerson catches her before she hits the ground and picks her up bridal style, heading towards Miles and Scarlet.<br><br>

"Liv! Are you alright?" Miles shouts when Emerson approaches.<br><br>

"Will everyone please stop asking me that!" Olivia grumbles.<br><br>

Emerson sits her on one of the benches on the second wagon that the group brought, the first being used to hold the prisoners. <br><br>

"Emerson, I can ride," Olivia tells her.<br><br> 

"Are you sure? Your legs are seriously injured." Emerson points out.<br><br>

"Positive. Just hook me up, and I can ride back to the palace."<br><br>

Emerson sighs and picks up Olivia again, placing her on the back of her horse and strapping her in. She winced slightly when he did up the buckle on her left leg but brushed it off. He asked her again if she could ride, and she insisted she would be alright. <br><br>

Everyone else mounted their horses, and then they started to move. <br><br>

Olivia grabbed the reins of her horse and followed along, riding beside Emerson, Miles, and Scarlet leading the group back to the palace. <br><br>

As the group rode through the kingdom, clapping and cheering echoed through the people, celebrating the defeat of the murderer. <br><br>

The group finally reached the palace, having to go slower than before because of all the injuries people had suffered. <br><br>

Emerson helped Olivia off her horse, placing about 95% of her weight on his shoulders, doing her best to walk. <br><br>

"Oh, my god. Olvia, what happened to you!" her mother cried as soon as she and the king emerged from the palace entrance.<br><br>

Too focused on staying upright, she remained silent, but Emerson answered for her. <br><br>

"We encountered the prisoner in a village far from where Scarlet's father lives. He had about two dozen men with him, and a fight broke out. We all suffered various injuries, but Olivia got the worst of it. She has a deep gash running from her left shoulder blade down to her wrist and another from her left hip to the bottom of her ankle. Despite her injuries, she was able to capture the prisoner in the heat of the battle with great aid from Miles as well. The prisoner and the attackers that surrendered are currently in the wagons." Emerson explains, and the king and queen look stunned. <br><br>

"Take the prisoners to the dungeons," Miles tells the guardsmen, and the group enters the palace. <br><br>

Instead of going to the large throne room, the king and queen lead the group to a large sitting room, a few couches surrounding a large wooden coffee table and pillows piled onto the ends of the sofas. <br><br>

Emerson helps Olivia to one of the couches, then sits beside her. Miles and Scarlet sit on separate couches, and the king and queen sit on the last couch. <br><br>

The king is talking to Miles and Scarlet about something that Olivia couldn't make out. Olivia looks like she's about to pass out, and Emerson gets one of the servants to fetch her a glass of water. She brings the glass to her lips and tries to concentrate on what her father says. <br><br>

"-you're sure that no one in the group you fought escaped during the battle?" King Darius asks his son. <br><br>

"I'm positive, father. Even though they overpowered us in numbers, we had the advantage of skill. We ensured that we involved each person in the battle, and if they tried to escape, they would be killed. All of the attackers have either surrendered or have been killed."<br><br>

"Very good."<br><br>

"Olivia, dear? Are you sure you're going to be alright?" Queen Fiona asks her, concern drawn all over her face.<br><br>

"I'm fine, mother," Olivia whispers, still lightheaded. <br><br>

Once the guardsmen were done bringing the prisoners to the dungeons, they entered the room, standing in line at the back of the room in total silence.  <br><br>

"Thank you, all, for your help in capturing the escaped prisoner. You may go back to the barracks now and get some rest. You must be exhausted." The king tells the guardsmen, and they give him a thankful look and head back to the barracks. 

Over the next half hour, the four informed the king and queen about everything that happened while they were on their journey. Eventually, the king called the meeting, seeing that his daughter looked as pale as a ghost. She was taken to the hospital wing right away, being treated for her injuries, thankful they weren't infected. Emerson stayed by her side the entire time, refusing to leave.
