<h1>Chapter Three</h1>

 <p>Back in the dining hall, the servants cleaned up the mess from the previous night, and the royal family sat down to eat. The king and queen are sitting at the heads of the table, opposite of each other, with their children on either side of the table. Miles is sitting to Darius's right with Jake beside him, and on the other side of the table, Olivia is seated to her mother's right, and the chair beside her is empty.<br><br>

“Olivia, sweety, do you know where your brother is?” Queen Fiona asked. <br><br>

"No, I have no clue. The last time I saw Donovan was when I gave him our search results today." Olivia responded, worried about where her brother could be. <br><br> 

They've been waiting fifteen minutes, and Donovan still has yet to arrive. He's always been on time. Usually, it's anyone except Donovan and Queen Fiona that's late. Sometimes Olivia takes too long to get ready. Miles is usually training and needs to catch up on time. Jake is usually reviewing the events that are happening throughout the kingdom. And Darius is generally held up in meetings most of the time, making him late for dinner. But Donovan being late is very unlikely.<br><br> 

Worried about her brother, Olivia gets up from the table.<br><br>

“Where are you going?” Darius asked her. <br><br>

"I'm worried about Donovan. He's never late for dinner. I fear something bad has happened to him." she replied. <br><br>

The rest of her family followed her out of the dining hall and made their way up to Donovan's study. When they reach his study, the door is slightly ajar. Olivia pushes the door open and screams. Tears are running down her face at sight. Her brother's body lay motionless on the ground, surrounded by a pool of blood and a knife in his heart. Not caring about her dress anymore, she kneels beside her brother, entangling her hand in his, crying over his body.<br><br> 

Queen Fiona sobs as well, kneeling beside her daughter. The remaining princes have mixed emotions spread across their faces. Shock, anger, sadness, grief, and sorrow mixed. And King Darius, known for always staying strong, no matter what, showing no emotion whatsoever, lets a tear fall down his face. The only sign people will see is that he's upset about his son's death. On the outside, the king has to stay vital for his family, but inside, he's broken. The king never thought he would live to see the day that one of his children would get a knife to the heart. He knew that he would do anything in his power to avenge his son and stop this madman.<br><br> 

On shaky legs, Olivia slowly gets up and stands beside her brothers. She must lean against Miles to keep her upright, or she will collapse on the floor. Out of all the siblings, Olivia was the closest with Donovan, and now that he's gone, she feels empty inside. Miles places his arm around her shoulders in an attempt to comfort her. Tears still fall down Olivia's face, and she cannot stop them. She wipes her face, trying to remove as many tears as possible, and retreats into Miles's pleasing shape. He pulls her closer, wrapping his arms around her in a hug. <br><br>

After a long time, the royal family leaves his room and orders the servants to prepare his body for the funeral. The one thing they did do before they left was to take the knife out of his chest. The king holds it with a glove, making sure not to get his fingerprints on it. <br>

    <p>The following day, the palace planned a funeral for the death of Donovan Ambrose, the youngest son of King Darius and Queen Fiona. The queen and princess are both dressed in long, black mourning gowns. Their eyes reveal the amount of grief and sadness they have. The king and princes are in their uniforms, with a new arm patch representing Donovan's crest, a black rose surrounded by blue flames. Each member of the royal family has one, and whenever a member dies, the remaining members sew their crest onto their uniform as a sign of respect.<br><br> 

The royal family says their final goodbyes to Donovan, then he is left to rest with the rest of the deceased Ambrose family. 

Both princes are about to break, and the queen also has tears. Olivia has tears slowly falling her face, attempting not to break out into completely blown tears. The king is trying to stay vital for his family, but you can still tell that he's still grieving.<br><br>  

The public was also invited to watch the funeral, and they all had a look of mourning for the loss of one of the princes of Eslarthia. <br><br> 

When his body is covered, Olivia and Miles walk over to the tombstone carved with his crest and the Ambrose crest and place a bouquet next to it. The bouquet was a bouquet of black roses, Donovan's favourite—also why that flower is on his crest. Your crest is made up of the flower that you like and something that represents you. Donovan always loved the black roses in the palace gardens and the blue fire, which symbolized that he might be the youngest of the family, but he will always burn the brightest.<br><br> 
The two siblings walk away, Olivia about to break, and Miles about to start crying. <br><br>

The public soon exits the courtyard, and the royal family returns to the palace.<br><br> 

That night, no one could sleep. Olivia cried all night because of her dead brother. Miles and Jake were scared that they would be next to follow their deceased brother, and in the privacy of their rooms, they, too, shed tears for their brother. Queen Fiona was sobbing because of her son's death, and King Darius finally broke.<br>
