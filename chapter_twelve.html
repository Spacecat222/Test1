<h1>Chapter Twelve</h1>

<p>Over the course of the next few days, Olivia and Miles end up convincing Scarlet and Emerson to help them. Miles trains everyone in the barracks for the morning, then all of them will help Olivia with the investigation itself. <br><br>

Currently, Miles is sparring Olivia, and Emerson is sparring Scarlet. Each pair spars until one person can place their sword beside the other’s throat. Emerson beat Scarlet because he’s more experienced in fighting, and surprisingly, Olivia managed to beat Miles. <br><br>

“You’ve gotten better, Liv.” Miles tells her.<br><br>

“Thanks. By the way, you are really predictable when you spar, you know that?”<br><br>

“Sadly, yes. In my defence, I just go with what I know. Not trying to do some stupid move that I don’t normally do that could get me killed.” <br><br>

“Fair.” she shrugs.<br><br>

“Okay, I’m sparring with your fiancé next.” Miles says.<br><br>

“Don’t kill him, please.”<br><br>

“Why do you care all of a sudden? Do you like him or something?” Miles taunts, making Olivia blush slightly.<br><br>

“You do!” he gasps, taking in her blushing face.<br><br>

“Go spar with my fiancé, will you?” she responds, shoving him towards Emerson.<br><br>

“We’re continuing this conversation later.” he tells her, then goes to spar with Emerson. <br><br>

Olivia and Scarlet spar, and Olivia is surprised by Scarlet's abilities. <br><br>

“Where did you learn to spar so well?” she asks her.<br><br>

“My father thought it would be a good skill to learn. He also did it because we had all of the equipment.” Scarlet shrugs. <br><br>

“That’s nice of him.”<br>

<p>With all of the training that Miles has gotten Emerson, Olivia, and Scarlet to do, they’re in their best shape. Guaranteed, when they see the person that has been killing everybody, they will be ready. Also, with Miles, Scarlet and Emerson helping with the investigation, they’re further along than Olivia would’ve ever thought. <br><br>

Olivia had interrogated the three people that seemed the most suspicious, but she still didn’t get anymore leads on who exactly the murderer was. <br>

</p>

<p>One day, the four of them are walking out of the training grounds when one of the scholars that Olivia had sent to investigate while she was training came running up to them.<br><br>

“Liv! Liv! Emergency! Emergency!” she shouts, gasping for breath.<br><br>

“Hey! Hey! Mia, calm down. What’s going on?” Olivia asks her.<br><br>

“One of the prisoners has escaped!” Mia tells her.<br><br>
Olivia’s eyes widened, and despite running 15km that morning, she bolted towards the palace, the rest of them chasing after her. She threw open the palace doors and raced to the throne room.<br><br>

“What happened?” she demanded.<br><br>

“One of the prisoners escaped. We have a suspicion that they’re the murderer. I want you, Emerson, Miles, Scarlet, and the guard to search for the prisoner. Check every square inch of this kingdom, and don’t rest until you find him.” her father demanded.<br><br>

“Yes father.”<br><br>

She exited the throne room, and the three of them were waiting for her.<br><br>

“Miles, gather the best men of the guard that you can find and have them ready for a very long mission. Scarlet, can you see if your father would be able to lend yourself and Emerson some armour and weapons please. The four of us are going on a scavenger hunt.”<br>
