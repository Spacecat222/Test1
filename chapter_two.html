<h1>Chapter Two</h1>

In the dining hall, Princess Olivia and the scholars are examining the body of General Carlos. <br><br>

“Who do you think did this?” Addam asks us. <br><br>

“Not sure.” Olivia replied. <br><br>

Olivia had chosen a group of six scholars to help you investigate this case. These six scholars are the best in the kingdom, and she happened to be friends with all of them. <br><br>

When she was little, she read all of these mystery books and movies. She loved investigating cases and solving mysteries. She did this so much that she was named the best detective in the entire kingdom. So, whenever her father would need someone to investigate something, Olivia was his go to person.</p> 

      <p> Olivia wasn’t wearing her usual gown and tiara because she’s investigating the death of General Carlos. Instead, she was wearing black leggings, a navy blue shirt, and a pair of combat boots. She has her dark brown hair pulled into a tight bun so it doesn’t fall in front of her face. She’s kneeling beside the body of General Carlos, trying to figure out what type of poison was used. Her brother had told her to give him as much of a description about the body as possible, because it would help him figure out what type of poison was used. 

She examined his face closely, and noticed that his veins were so clear, it looked like his skin was made out of glass. At the corners of his mouth, white froth was evident, and his eyes were bloodshot. She took note of all of this in her notebook, and got up to examine the rest of the room. Her father had ordered that nothing be moved from the dining hall so we could get a better understanding of what happened. 

She had sent a few of the scholars to go down to the cellars and kitchens to see if someone had tampered with the food or drinks. The rest of them were helping her in the dining hall. <br><br>

“Addam, Parker, Mia, can you three go check to see if any of the other generals’ drinks were tampered with. They probably weren’t, since they’re still alive, but we can’t be too sure.” she says. <br><br>

Olivia walks over to where General Carlos was sitting last night to see what exactly had happened to him. The food couldn’t have been poisoned, since everyone had been taking food off of the giant platters in the center of the table. So, the only possibility was that the poison was in his drink. She picked up his glass, and swirled the wine around. It looked fine to her, but she didn’t want to take the chance to drink it herself. One thing she did notice was that the wine had a bluish tint to it, so she poured a sample of the wine into a glass phial, and shoved the phial into her pocket. She then walked back over to General Carlos’s body and drew a blood sample from him and also placed the sample in a glass phial. She shoved that phial into her pocket as well, then stood up.<br><br>

“Did any of you find anything important?” she asked.<br><br>

“We don’t believe that the other drinks have been tampered with. The food looks fine, and everything else looks normal.” Parker answered.<br><br>

The four of them heard footsteps approaching the dining hall, and they all spun around to see that it was just the rest of the scholars. 

“What did you three find?” Olivia asked them. <br><br>
“Nothing was wrong in the cellars or the kitchens, but we did find this.” a scholar with long, wavy black hair said, handing Olivia a bottle. 
        <br><br>

        “What is this?”</p>
    
    <p>“We believe it’s poison. We don’t know who it belongs to though. We saw the bottle resting on the counter.” <br><br>
      
     “Thank you, Emily. I will get this to my brother as soon as possible. Well, thank you all for your time. I think I have enough information for today. If you don’t mind, we’ll start again, same time tomorrow.” Olivia told them, exiting the dining hall.<br><br>

She made her way through the large castle, and up the stairs to her youngest brother’s room. She knocked on the door, and a few seconds later, a voice called for her to enter. <br><br>

“Hey, Donovan. I brought you the samples you asked for.” she says, handing him all three phials and the paper with the description about General Carlos.<br><br>

“I only asked for one. What are the other two?” he asks. <br><br>

“One of them is a blood sample. The other is a wine sample. And the other one Emily gave me. She told me that they found it on the counter in the kitchen. I think it’s poison, but I’m not exactly sure. I’m giving you all three to see if you can figure out if the poison in General Carlos’s blood is the same thing that’s in the other two phials. If so, we need to figure out who poisoned him before he kills anyone else.” Olivia responds. <br><br>

“Thanks, sis. I’ll do my best.”<br><br>

And with that, Olivia returned to her room to change. Since she’s no longer investigating, and that it’s just about dinner time, she has to change back into her usual gown and tiara. She changed into a sky blue gown and heels. Brushed her hair out and curled it slightly. Applied some make-up, and some jewelry. Once she was done, she made her way down to the throne room.<br>

After Olivia left his room, Donovan immediately went to work on examining the phials that she gave her. He looked at the paper that she handed him, and knew the symptoms of the poison immediately. The moonshadow poison is the most deadly poison in the entire continent. It was so rare that the only people to own it are the royal families of both kingdoms. He knew for a fact that the only time his family has ever used the moonshadow poison was because a decade ago, there was a mass murderer and was going insane. That was the only time in the entire history of the Ambrose family ruling Eslarthia had used it. That meant that the Whitlock family poisoned the General. The question was how. 

Just to be safe, Donovan ran a few tests on the samples, and they all returned with the same answer. Moonshadow poison. He locks the results into a drawer in my desk in case that there are spies in the castle, then heads towards the door. Before he's able to get there though, he feels a hand on my shoulder. He slowly turns around to see a person staring back at him with gleaming eyes. Before he can let out a scream in warning, the person lifts his hand to reveal a blade, and stabs it through his heart.  

Donovan drops to the ground, blood pooling around him.<br></p>
