<h1>Chapter Sixteen</h1>

<p>In the dining hall, everyone is celebrating that the murderer is officially gone, the five of them changing into something more formal for the feast. <br><br>

"Here's to the fact that the murderer is gone!" King Darius cheers, raising his glass into the air.<br><br>

"Here, here!" they shout, and the feast begins. <br>

After the feast, the five decided to hang out briefly. <br><br>

They're all sitting in the palace gardens without care.<br><br>

"I'm so glad that this whole thing is over now. As much as I like investigating, it usually doesn't last long. That was way too long." Olivia says.<br><br>

"True. Also, dear brother, as much as I don't like how it was forced on me, thank you for arranging the ball." Miles adds.<br><br>

"Ah, yes. Thank you for making me become Emerson's fiancé way earlier than I would've liked. Speaking of, when are you going to get a girlfriend?" Olivia taunts. <br><br>

"That's right………. You're only sixteen. You better start looking for a girlfriend now, or else you won't know who you will have to marry in four years. Either that or father will make you marry someone you don't like." Miles adds.<br><br>

"Isn't that how you did it?" Jake asks him.<br><br>

"Nope. I knew that I wanted to marry Scarlet since I was your age. I didn't tell her soon enough. But you, you need to get on it. I'm sure there's some girl in this kingdom that you like."<br><br>

"Can we talk about something else, please?" Jake pleads, blushing like crazy.<br><br>

"Fine," Olivia sighs. <br><br>

"But this conversation isn't over," Miles tells him, earning a chuckle from Scarlet and Emerson.<br><br>

"So, Jake, you seem to have the inside scoop about everything in the twins' lives. Do you, by chance, know when the royal weddings are?" Emerson asks him, earning Olivia, Miles, and Scarlet to blush.<br><br>

"Probably in about a few months. I heard mother and father talking about it. They didn't tell me exactly when though."<br><br>

"You know, this may sound cheesy, but I had a lot of fun with you guys when we were training and investigating. I've never really had a lot of people to talk to, and you guys made me feel welcome. Thank you." Scarlet says.<br><br>

"No problem, Scar."<br><br>

"One thing I've been meaning to ask you, Liv, was how did you learn to shoot so well?" Emerson asks her.<br><br>

"My parents had Miles and me training since we could walk. We had the best instructors in the kingdom, and we eventually became better than them by age thirteen. After that, we taught ourselves. Every once and a while, I would go out to the archery range and shoot for fun. I would also do that while throwing apples and discs, and sometimes I would shoot down moving targets in the sky. It was honestly entertaining."<br><br>

"So, how does it feel to be drama free?" Jake asks them.<br><br>

"Great. No more murderers. No more death. No more problems." Miles sighs in relief. <br><br>

"Agreed."<br>

That night, everyone in the kingdom could sleep easier, knowing they didn't have a threat to the kingdom looming over their heads.<br><br> 

The Ambrose children went to sleep, knowing they could put the unrest in their minds since Donovan's death to sleep, finally avenging his death. <br><br>

Miles was also content because he wouldn't drag Scarlet into danger, even if she chose to come along.<br><br>

Emerson could sleep easier knowing that Olivia wouldn't be harmed any more, given that there wasn't a threat to the kingdom.<br><br>

And Scarlet slept easier because Miles wasn't pushing himself every day, to the point that he would collapse to be prepared for another attack on the kingdom or have to run out of the palace in case people thought that they saw the murderer. <br><br>

Today was the day that Eslarthia could finally have peace again.<br><br>
