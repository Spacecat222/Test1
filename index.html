<p>One hundred years ago, a war broke out between the Kingdom of Eslarthia and the Kingdom of Ilratheino. A century later, the king of Eslarthia ended the war by defeating the king of Ilratheino in a duel, Eslarthia winning the war. During a feast celebrating their victory, the right hand man of the king is murdered. More murders are happening within the palace walls, and the king has to do something to stop the threat to the kingdom.
<br><br>
The king sends his four children to aid in the investigation of the murder. Prince Miles training the guard, Princess Olivia leading the investigation itself, Prince Donovan studying all of the substances Olivia finds, and Prince Jake on the political aspect of the situation.
<br><br>
When one of them is killed, the royal family crumbles. While picking up the pieces, the royal family from the enemy kingdom arrives. They offer unity between the two kingdoms to keep the peace. 
<br><br>
With the offer from the enemy kingdom, having to deal with the loss of one of their children, an ongoing murder investigation, and their oldest son having to find someone to marry, the king and queen are scrambling to figure out what to do. 
<br><br>
Follow this journey, mostly through the eyes of the princess, as her family figures out how to deal with the threat to their kingdom, their enemy in town, and the loss of a prince.
